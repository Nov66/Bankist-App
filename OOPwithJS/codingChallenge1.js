/*
Your tasks:

1. Use a constructor function to implement a 'Car'. A car has a 'make' and a 'speed' property. The 'speed' property is the current speed of the car in km/h

2. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 10, and log the new speed to the console

3. Implement a 'brake' method that will decrease the car's speed by 5, and log the new speed to the console

4. Create 2 'Car' objects and experiment with calling 'accelerate' and 'brake' multiple times on each of them

Test data:
Data car 1: 'BMW' going at 120 km/h 
Data car 2: 'Mercedes' going at 95 km/h

const Car = function (make, speed) {
  this.make = make;
  this.speed = speed;
};

Car.prototype.accelerate = function () {
  this.speed += 10;
  console.log(`${this.make} new speed is ${this.speed}`);
};

Car.prototype.brake = function () {
  this.speed -= 5;
  console.log(`${this.make} new speed is ${this.speed}`);
};

console.log(Car.prototype);

const car1 = new Car('BMW', 120);
const car2 = new Car('Mercedes', 95);

car1.accelerate();
car1.brake();
car2.accelerate();
car2.brake();
